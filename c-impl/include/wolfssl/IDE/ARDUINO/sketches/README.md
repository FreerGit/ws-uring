# wolfSSL Arduino Examples

There are currently two example Arduino sketches:

* [wolfssl_client](./wolfssl_client/README.md): Basic TLS listening client.
* [wolfssl_server](./wolfssl_server/README.md): Basic TLS server.

Examples have been most recently confirmed operational on the
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) 2.2.1.

For examples on other platforms, see the [IDE directory](https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl/tree/master/IDE).
